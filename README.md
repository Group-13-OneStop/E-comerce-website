# OneStop: An E-commerce Website

The OneStop e-commerce website is a web application that allows users to buy and sell products. It is divided into three sections: Men's, Women's, and Kids. Each section has a list of products that users can browse and purchase.

The website uses the **Razorpay API** to allow for secure payments. This means that users can be confident that their financial information is safe when they make a purchase. The website also uses the **GoogleAuth API** to allow for user authentication. This means that users can create an account and log in to the website to track their orders and manage their profile.

In addition to the public-facing website, there is also a **seller dashboard** that sellers can use to manage their products. The seller dashboard allows sellers to add, view, and delete products. It also allows sellers to track sales, products listed, and other metrics.

- The project is built using the **Django** framework.
- The project uses a **Sqlite** database to store data.
